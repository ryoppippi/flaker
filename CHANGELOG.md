# Changelog

## 0.10.5

Rebrand cleanup. Resolves the three deferred items from 0.10.4.

### Changed

- `src/cli/core/loader.ts`: `MetriciCore` interface renamed to `FlakerCore`. Call sites, JSDoc, and FFI glue updated across 9 files. Last rebrand leftover in the TypeScript codebase (closes #68).

### Docs

- `docs/adr/008-apply-first-architecture.md`: NEW. Supersedes ADR-001 as the current architecture SSOT, documenting the apply-first reconciler introduced in 0.10.0 (DesiredState/ObservedState/StateDiff, DAG executor, advisory promotion thresholds). ADR-001 marked superseded (closes #67).

### Removed

- `release-please` tooling removed (`.github/workflows/release-please.yml`, `release-please-config.json`, `.release-please-manifest.json`). The 0.x line is released manually; `docs/contributing.md` now documents the seven-step manual release flow. Publishing to npm remains automated via `.github/workflows/publish.yml` on tag push (closes #66).

## 0.10.4

Docs patch. ADR audit follow-up.

### Docs

- `docs/adr/002-dependency-resolver-strategy.md`: pointer to ADR-006 added for unified `GraphAdapter` graph construction.
- `docs/adr/003-runner-adapter-and-orchestration.md`: runner table row renamed from `MoonBit` to `moontest`; new `actrun` row added.
- `docs/adr/005-actrun-integration.md`: "three paths" section rewritten to reflect the 0.10.0 apply-first flow (apply collects via `collect_ci`, `run --runner actrun` for local workflows, `import` for arbitrary reports).
- `docs/adr/006-graph-analysis-ownership.md`: status line added — Phase 1 + 2 shipped (MoonBit core at `src/graph/graph_core.mbt`, `GraphResolver` delegates via `loadCore()`). Phase 3 (upstream bitflow takeover) remains open.

### Deferred

- **ADR-001 full rewrite** (tracked in #67) — still uses pre-rebrand "metrici" name + enumerates a 0.5-era CLI surface. Bigger than an in-place patch, needs a supersede ADR or a full rewrite.
- **`MetriciCore` TypeScript rename** (tracked in #68) — rebrand leftover in `src/cli/core/loader.ts`.
- **release-please decision** (tracked in #66) — workflow is dormant; manifest manually synced each release. Keep, adopt, or remove.

## 0.10.3

Docs patch + Tier-1 audit results.

### Docs

- `docs/how-to-use.md` Vitest adapter example now writes `type = "vitest"` (was `"playwright"` with a misleading "vitest --reporter json is Playwright-compatible" comment). JA was corrected in 0.7.1; EN parallel fix was missed until now. Also adds the `vitest run --reporter=json --outputFile=report.json` incantation alongside `flaker import`.

### Audit surfaced but deferred

- ~20 other SQL sites (`CO_FAILURE_QUERY`, status activity query, analyze/{bundle,context,eval,insights,kpi}.ts) still use `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL`, the same pattern 0.10.2 fixed in `FLAKY_QUERY`. Tests currently pass because window sizes are generous; latent bug tracked as #64 for a future minor.

## 0.10.2

Bug fix: `queryFlakyTests` window cutoff is now computed from a caller-supplied `now` (or wall clock) in JS, not from DuckDB's `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`. Resolves a timezone-dependent flake that surfaced as a failing `tests/commands/ops-daily.test.ts` whenever wall clock advanced past the test's injected `now`.

### Fixed

- `DuckDBStore.queryFlakyTests(opts)` accepts a new optional `opts.now?: Date` parameter. The SQL `FLAKY_QUERY` now takes a pre-computed cutoff literal instead of `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL (? || ' days')`. Same behavior at wall clock; deterministic under test injection.
- `runQuarantineSuggest({ now })` threads `now` through to `queryFlakyTests`, so `runOpsDaily({ now, windowDays })` is fully deterministic end-to-end.

### Impact

Production users see no behavior change — the default path uses `new Date()` as the reference time. Tests that inject `now: new Date("2026-04-19T00:00:00Z")` and run later than that now correctly pick up test data within their configured window. The previous behavior silently dropped test data older than the wall-clock window.

### Known limitations

Other `queryFlakyTests` / `queryTestCoFailures` call sites in `src/cli/commands/analyze/*.ts` and `src/cli/commands/policy/quarantine.ts` still use the wall-clock default. They're production code paths where `now` isn't meaningful; left alone to scope the patch. If determinism becomes needed in those paths, extend them with the same `now?` parameter.

## 0.10.1

Docs patch (closes #60). No code changes.

### Docs

`docs/how-to-use.md` (EN) backfilled with 9 sections previously JA-only:

1. `flaker plan` / `flaker apply` — declarative convergence (0.9.0 feature)
2. co-failure clustering / `[sampling].cluster_mode` (0.9.0 feature, issue #39)
3. `flaker debug retry` — CI failure local reproduction
4. `flaker debug confirm` — 3-way failure classification (BROKEN / FLAKY / TRANSIENT)
5. Jest adapter configuration
6. JUnit XML runner configuration
7. `[runner.actrun]` per-runner examples (Playwright + Vitest)
8. `flaky_tag_pattern` / `skip_flaky_tagged` runner behavior matrix
9. `glob` resolver

Plus the `vrt-migration` versioned schema section (pre-existing adjacent to `flaker import`; translated along with the 9-item list). No structural changes; pure JA→EN translation.

EN heading count: 45 → 54 (JA reference: 51).

## 0.10.0 (breaking)

Terraform-parity apply surface + `ops daily` removal + docs sweep. Replaces the previously-scoped 1.0.0 — we remain on the 0.x line until empirical stability justifies 1.0.

### New

- `flaker apply --target <kind>` — partial reconciliation; runs only actions of the given kind (`collect_ci | calibrate | cold_start_run | quarantine_apply`), shows the rest as `status: "skipped"` with `skippedReason: "not in --target"`.
- `flaker apply --refresh-only` — run probe + state-diff + planApply but skip `executeDag`. Writes a `PlanArtifact` when `--output` is set.
- `flaker apply --plan-file <file>` — load a previously-saved `PlanArtifact`, skip the planner, execute the stored actions. Warns + aborts (unless `--force`) when the current observed state has new drift kinds absent from the stored plan.
- `flaker apply --force` — skip the `--plan-file` drift guard.
- `flaker apply --emit incident` now has full wiring (was a stub in 0.9.0). New flags: `--incident-run <id>`, `--incident-suite <name>`, `--incident-test <name>`. Requires `--incident-run` OR both `--incident-suite` AND `--incident-test`.
- `deserializePlanArtifact()` helper in `src/cli/commands/apply/artifact.ts` with shape validation.

### Removed (breaking)

- `flaker ops daily` — the 0.9.0 deprecation cycle (one minor version) is complete. Use `flaker apply --emit daily`. `runOpsDaily` action code kept internally since apply still calls it.
- `src/cli/deprecation.ts` helper — no remaining in-tree callers after `ops daily` removal.

### Docs

- `docs/how-to-use.md` (EN) parallel sweep matching the 0.9.1 JA cleanup: removes 5 stale top-level sections for commands deleted in 0.8.0.
- Full `flaker explain` umbrella section in both JA and EN covering all 5 topics (`reason / insights / cluster / bundle / context`).
- `flaker dev` subtree relocated to a single `Advanced / Maintainer tools` section at the end of both JA and EN references; inline pointer retained in the old location.

### Known gaps (follow-up)

- EN `docs/how-to-use.md` is missing 9 sections present in JA (declarative convergence, debug retry/confirm, Jest adapter, JUnit runner, etc.). Tracked in #60 as a backfill for 0.10.1 or later.

## 0.9.1

Docs patch (closes #58). No code changes.

### Docs

`docs/how-to-use.ja.md` had five stale top-level sections for commands removed in 0.8.0. Each is replaced with a pointer to the canonical 0.9.0 form:

| Stale section | Replaced by |
|---|---|
| `flaker analyze flaky` | `flaker status --list flaky` |
| `flaker analyze reason` | `flaker explain reason` (consolidated with the 4 other explain topics under one section) |
| `flaker policy quarantine` | `flaker apply` + `[quarantine].auto` (plus pointer to `flaker status --list quarantined`) |
| `flaker analyze eval` | `flaker status --markdown [--detail] [--gate <name>]` |
| `flaker analyze query` | top-level `flaker query` |

No behavior changes. Deferred to 0.10.0 (see #58): English `docs/how-to-use.md` parallel sweep, full `flaker explain` umbrella section with all 5 topics documented individually, `dev` subtree relocation to an Advanced subsection.

## 0.9.0

Resource-diff plan model, DAG executor, and `flaker apply --output` / `--emit`.

### New

- `src/cli/commands/apply/state.ts`: `DesiredState`, `ObservedState`, `StateDiff`, `computeStateDiff()` — the plan is now derived from a structured state diff, not an ad-hoc action list.
- `planApply()` returns `{ diff, actions }`. Each `PlannedAction` carries `driftRef: StateDiffField[]` naming the observed fields the action reconciles.
- `src/cli/commands/apply/dag.ts`: `executeDag(actions, deps)` replaces the abort-on-failure `executePlan`. Independent actions run concurrently via `Promise.all`; a failed action causes only its downstream to be marked `skipped`, peers still run.
- `flaker plan --output <file>` and `flaker apply --output <file>` write a JSON artifact containing `generatedAt`, `diff`, `actions`, `probe`, and (for apply) `executed`.
- `flaker apply --emit daily|weekly|incident` produces the matching ops-cadence artifact alongside normal apply execution. `daily` and `weekly` are fully wired; `incident` is a stub that points at `flaker ops incident` until 1.0.0.
- Small `src/cli/deprecation.ts` helper re-added (was removed in 0.8.0) to support `ops daily` re-deprecation.

### Changed

- **Breaking JSON shape** for `flaker apply --json`:
  - `executed[*].ok: boolean` → `executed[*].status: "ok" | "failed" | "skipped"`
  - top-level `aborted: boolean` removed
  - `executed[*].skippedReason?: string` new field
- **Breaking JSON shape** for `flaker status --json`:
  - `drift.unmet[*].field` → `drift.unmet[*].kind`
  - `drift.unmet[*].threshold` → `drift.unmet[*].desired`
- `flaker apply` text output uses tri-state marks (`ok  ` / `fail` / `skip`).
- `flaker apply` exit code is 1 only when some action failed; skipped actions do not fail the process.
- Internal `executePlan()` is kept as a thin `@deprecated` wrapper that maps DAG status → legacy `ok: boolean` for backward-compatible unit-test callers.

### Deprecated (removed in 1.0.0)

- `flaker ops daily` — use `flaker apply --emit daily`. The 0.7.0 Phase 1 deprecation was reverted in 0.7.0 Phase 2 because apply didn't emit the daily artifact. 0.9.0 fixes that gap, so the original canonical pointer is now real.
- `ops weekly` and `ops incident` remain first-class (they carry operator narrative beyond what apply currently emits).

## 0.8.0 (breaking)

Removes the 17 commands deprecated in 0.7.0. Scripts and CI workflows still using any of the legacy forms below will now exit non-zero. Users on 0.7.x should first work through [docs/migration-0.6-to-0.7.md](docs/migration-0.6-to-0.7.md) before upgrading; the mapping is unchanged from the 0.7.0 deprecation cycle.

### Removed

| Removed | Use instead |
|---|---|
| `flaker setup init` | `flaker init` |
| `flaker exec run` / `flaker exec affected` | `flaker run` / `flaker run --gate iteration --changed <paths>` |
| `flaker collect` / `collect ci` / `collect local` / `collect coverage` / `collect commit-changes` / `collect calibrate` | `flaker apply` |
| `flaker quarantine suggest` / `flaker quarantine apply` | `flaker apply` |
| `flaker policy quarantine` / `flaker policy check` / `flaker policy report` | `flaker apply` |
| `flaker gate review <name>` / `flaker gate history <name>` / `flaker gate explain <name>` | `flaker status --gate <name> [--detail] [--json]` |
| `flaker analyze kpi` | `flaker status` |
| `flaker analyze eval` | `flaker status --markdown` |
| `flaker analyze flaky` | `flaker status --list flaky` |
| `flaker analyze flaky-tag` | `flaker apply` |
| `flaker analyze reason` / `insights` / `cluster` / `bundle` / `context` | `flaker explain <topic>` |
| `flaker analyze query` | `flaker query <sql>` |
| `flaker import report <file>` / `flaker import parquet <dir>` | `flaker import <file>` (adapter auto-detected) |
| `flaker report summary` / `report diff` / `report aggregate` | `flaker report <file> --summary \| --diff <base> \| --aggregate <dir>` |
| `flaker debug doctor` | `flaker doctor` |
| `flaker kpi` (top-level alias) | `flaker status` (or `flaker analyze kpi`, itself removed → also `flaker status`) |

### Other changes

- Help output no longer has a "Deprecated" section. Primary + Advanced only.
- Internal `src/cli/deprecation.ts` helper removed (no remaining in-tree consumers).
- Registration-only category files removed: `src/cli/categories/{setup,exec,collect,quarantine,policy,gate}.ts`. The underlying action functions in `src/cli/commands/**` are retained because they back `flaker apply`, `flaker status`, `flaker explain`, etc.
- `execRunAction` and `RUN_COMMAND_HELP` moved from `src/cli/categories/exec.ts` to `src/cli/commands/run.ts`.
- `setupInitAction` kept in `src/cli/commands/setup/init.ts`.

### Migration

Mapping identical to 0.7.0. See [docs/migration-0.6-to-0.7.md](docs/migration-0.6-to-0.7.md) and the grep checklist in that doc — deferred migration now fails at runtime rather than emitting a warning.

## 0.7.1

Runner-agnostic docs fix. Resolves the Vitest/Jest overfit issue surfaced by the Iter 6.5 hold-out evaluation (closes #53).

### Fixed

- `flaker init` now defaults to `resolver = "simple"` instead of the misleading `"git"` alias. Both resolve to `SimpleResolver`, but `"simple"` is self-documenting. The generated TOML includes an inline comment enumerating all 5 supported resolver values.
- Docs: `how-to-use.ja.md` Vitest example now writes `[adapter] type = "vitest"` (not `"playwright"`). The previous note claiming "vitest --reporter json is Playwright-compatible" was misleading — `vitest` is a first-class adapter.

### Docs

- New Jest section and JUnit XML (runner-agnostic) section in `how-to-use.ja.md`.
- New `[runner.actrun]` examples now cover both Playwright and Vitest.
- New runner-by-runner `flaky_tag_pattern` / `skip_flaky_tagged` behavior matrix: `@flaky` grep is Playwright-only. For Vitest and Jest, `skip_flaky_tagged = true` is a documented no-op; workarounds (`test.skipIf`, `--testNamePattern`) are listed.
- Unified resolver selection table across `how-to-use.ja.md` and `new-project-checklist.ja.md`: all 5 values (`simple` / `workspace` / `glob` / `bitflow` / `moon`) with usage guidance. `git` documented as alias of `simple`.
- `vitest run --reporter=json --outputFile=report.json` → `flaker import <file>` / `flaker report <file> --summary --adapter vitest` flow now documented end-to-end.

### Evaluation

Iter 6.5 hold-out scenario (Vitest single-package library) re-ran against the updated docs:

- **Accuracy**: 42% → **91.7%** (+49.7pt)
- **[critical] 1 (Vitest flaker.toml)**: 部分的 → ○
- **[critical] 2 (resolver selection)**: 部分的 → ○

Target was ≥82% (Iter 6 A/B/C average − 15pt); cleared by 9.7pt. Overfit resolved.

## 0.7.0

### Deprecated (removed in 0.8.0)

All listed below still work; they now emit a stderr warning pointing at
the 0.7.0 canonical replacement.

| Deprecated | Canonical replacement |
|---|---|
| `flaker setup init` | `flaker init` |
| `flaker exec run` / `flaker exec affected` | `flaker run` / `flaker run --gate iteration --changed <paths>` |
| `flaker ops daily` | `flaker apply` |
| `flaker collect ci / local / coverage / commit-changes / calibrate` | `flaker apply` |
| `flaker quarantine suggest / apply` | `flaker apply` |
| `flaker policy quarantine / check / report` | `flaker apply` |
| `flaker gate review / history / explain` | `flaker status --gate <name> [--detail]` |
| `flaker analyze kpi` | `flaker status` |
| `flaker analyze eval` | `flaker status --markdown` |
| `flaker analyze flaky` | `flaker status --list flaky` |
| `flaker analyze flaky-tag` | `flaker apply` |
| `flaker analyze reason / insights / cluster / bundle / context` | `flaker explain <topic>` |
| `flaker analyze query` | `flaker query <sql>` |
| `flaker import report / parquet` | `flaker import <file>` (auto-detect) |
| `flaker report summary / diff / aggregate` | `flaker report <file> --summary \| --diff <base> \| --aggregate <dir>` |
| `flaker debug doctor` | `flaker doctor` |

### New

- `flaker plan` / `flaker apply` — declarative reconciler (shipped in 0.6.0, promoted to primary in 0.7.0)
- `flaker status` gained `--markdown`, `--list flaky|quarantined`, `--detail`, `--gate <name>`
- `flaker query <sql>` top-level
- `flaker explain <topic>` umbrella for AI-assisted analysis
- `flaker import <file>` auto-detects adapter from extension
- `flaker report <file>` uses `--summary` / `--diff` / `--aggregate` flags
- `[promotion]` config section with documented defaults
- `[promotion].data_confidence_min` validated against the `low|moderate|high` enum
- `flaker init` now writes `[profile.local]` / `[profile.ci]` / `[profile.scheduled]` defaults
- `flaker apply` prints actionable stderr hints when the plan is empty or cold-start discovered 0 tests

### Changed

- `flaker --help` reorganized into three tiers: Primary (11), Advanced, Deprecated
- Primary command surface reduced from 53 to 11 user-facing entries (hidden `dev *` subtree retained)
- `flaker doctor` is now the canonical form; `flaker debug doctor` is the deprecated alias (reversed from pre-0.7 polarity)
- `flaker ops daily` is Advanced, not Deprecated — the aspirational "apply absorbs daily" did not actually ship yet

### Fixed

- `flaker apply` now aborts cleanly when `GITHUB_TOKEN` is missing (previously `process.exit(1)` bypassed the executor's abort handler)
- `probeRepo.hasLocalHistory` now queries `workflow_runs` instead of being hardcoded `false`
- `flaker --version` prints a single line (was leaking `flaker core CLI 0.1.0 (js)` from an eager moonbit bridge import)
- `flaker status --gate <name>` no longer crashes on the filtered gates object (text formatter was hardcoded to iterate all three gate names)
- Deprecation warnings now reference the full command path (`flaker analyze kpi`) instead of just the leaf (`flaker kpi`), fixing 18 misleading or self-referential warnings

### Docs

- New `docs/migration-0.6-to-0.7.md` with full deprecation matrix + upgrade recipe + grep checklist
- `skills/flaker-setup/SKILL.md` and `skills/flaker-management/SKILL.md` rewritten for the 10-command surface
- `docs/new-project-checklist.{ja,md}` unified on apply+status flow
- `docs/operations-guide.ja.md` daily loop simplified to `apply + status`
- `README.md` Quick Start collapsed from Path 1/Path 2 split into a single 6-command block
- Canonical command forms table moved to README and kept as single-source-of-truth

## [0.5.0](https://github.com/mizchi/flaker/compare/flaker-v0.4.0...flaker-v0.5.0) (2026-04-18)

### Migration guide

Upgrading from `0.4.x` does **not** require a `flaker.toml` rename.
The main change is the recommended user-facing CLI surface:

- prefer `flaker run --gate iteration|merge|release` over profile-oriented examples
- prefer `flaker doctor` over `flaker debug doctor`
- prefer `flaker status` over `flaker analyze kpi` for the default dashboard

Existing profile-based configs and commands remain supported:

- `profile.local`, `profile.ci`, `profile.scheduled` still work
- `flaker run --profile ...` is still supported for advanced and custom setups
- existing category commands under `analyze`, `debug`, `policy`, and `dev` are unchanged

For a practical migration checklist, see:

- [docs/migration-0.4-to-0.5.ja.md](docs/migration-0.4-to-0.5.ja.md)
- [docs/migration-0.4-to-0.5.md](docs/migration-0.4-to-0.5.md)

### Highlights

- gate-oriented daily workflow: `flaker run --gate iteration`, `flaker doctor`, `flaker status`
- docs are split by audience: usage vs operations
- management guidance is now explicit for advisory/required gates, quarantine, and staged E2E/VRT rollout

### Compatibility notes

- no config-key migration is required from `0.4.x`
- this is a conceptual UX migration, not a hard CLI break like `0.2.0`
- if you already use custom profiles in CI, you can keep them and adopt gates gradually in docs and scripts

### Miscellaneous Chores

* trigger release-please 0.5.0 ([7714a53](https://github.com/mizchi/flaker/commit/7714a532dca266ecf45838d38c310a5358fd45db))

## 0.3.0 — 2026-04-10

Republishes the 0.2.0 CLI redesign under a new minor version so that downstream releases (npm `@mizchi/flaker`, mooncakes `mizchi/flaker`) track the same semver. No functional changes relative to 0.2.0; see the 0.2.0 entry below for the full breaking-change list.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-04-10

### Breaking changes

This release restructures the CLI into a two-level category hierarchy, merges `sample` into `run --dry-run`, and renames config keys to follow a suffix-per-unit convention. There is no backward compatibility layer. Configs and scripts must be updated before upgrading.

See the [redesign spec](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-10-flaker-cli-redesign-design.md) for the full rationale and the [config migration section](docs/how-to-use.md#config-migration) for the `flaker.toml` rename map.

#### Removed commands

- `flaker sample` — use `flaker run --dry-run` (add `--explain` for selection reasons).

#### Renamed commands

| Old | New |
|---|---|
| `flaker collect` | `flaker collect ci` (alias `flaker collect` preserved) |
| `flaker collect-local` | `flaker collect local` |
| `flaker collect-coverage` | `flaker collect coverage` |
| `flaker collect-commit-changes` | `flaker collect commit-changes` |
| `flaker calibrate` | `flaker collect calibrate` |
| `flaker import <file>` | `flaker import report <file>` |
| `flaker import-parquet <dir>` | `flaker import parquet <dir>` |
| `flaker affected` | `flaker exec affected` |
| `flaker report summarize` | `flaker report summary` |
| `flaker flaky` | `flaker analyze flaky` |
| `flaker reason` | `flaker analyze reason` |
| `flaker insights` | `flaker analyze insights` |
| `flaker eval` | `flaker analyze eval` |
| `flaker context` | `flaker analyze context` |
| `flaker query` | `flaker analyze query` |
| `flaker diagnose` | `flaker debug diagnose` |
| `flaker bisect` | `flaker debug bisect` |
| `flaker confirm` | `flaker debug confirm` |
| `flaker retry` | `flaker debug retry` |
| `flaker doctor` | `flaker debug doctor` |
| `flaker quarantine` | `flaker policy quarantine` |
| `flaker check` | `flaker policy check` |
| `flaker train` | `flaker dev train` |
| `flaker tune` | `flaker dev tune` |
| `flaker self-eval` | `flaker dev self-eval` |
| `flaker eval-fixture` | `flaker dev eval-fixture` |
| `flaker eval-co-failure-window` | `flaker dev eval-co-failure` |
| `flaker test-key` | `flaker dev test-key` |

Top-level aliases preserved: `flaker init`, `flaker run`, `flaker kpi`, `flaker collect`.

#### Renamed flags

- `flaker collect ci --last <days>` → `--days <n>`

#### Renamed config keys

| Section | Old | New | Unit |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[sampling]` | `percentage` | `sample_percentage` | 0–100 |
| `[sampling]` | `co_failure_days` | `co_failure_window_days` | days |
| `[sampling]` | `detected_flaky_rate` | `detected_flaky_rate_ratio` | 0.0–1.0 |
| `[sampling]` | `detected_co_failure_strength` | `detected_co_failure_strength_ratio` | 0.0–1.0 |
| `[flaky]` | `detection_threshold` | `detection_threshold_ratio` | 0.0–1.0 |
| `[quarantine]` | `flaky_rate_threshold` | `flaky_rate_threshold_percentage` | 0–100 |
| `[profile.*]` | `percentage` | `sample_percentage` | 0–100 |
| `[profile.*]` | `co_failure_days` | `co_failure_window_days` | days |
| `[profile.*]` | `adaptive_fnr_low` | `adaptive_fnr_low_ratio` | 0.0–1.0 |
| `[profile.*]` | `adaptive_fnr_high` | `adaptive_fnr_high_ratio` | 0.0–1.0 |

The CLI refuses to start on legacy configs and prints migration hints pointing at [docs/how-to-use.md#config-migration](docs/how-to-use.md#config-migration).

`flaky_rate_threshold_percentage` is now taken literally as a percentage — previous silent auto-conversion from a 0–1 ratio is gone. If your old config had `flaky_rate_threshold = 0.3`, rename to `flaky_rate_threshold_percentage = 30`.

#### New `debug confirm` exit codes

| Code | Verdict | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | TRANSIENT | Not reproducible |
| 1 | FLAKY | Intermittent |
| 2 | BROKEN | Regression reproduced |
| 3 | ERROR | Runner or config failure |

### New features

- `flaker run --dry-run` — preview selection without executing.
- `flaker run --explain` — print per-test selection tier, score, and reason.
- `flaker setup init --adapter <type> --runner <type>` — generate populated `[adapter]` and `[runner]` sections in the created `flaker.toml`. Valid adapters: `playwright`, `vitest`, `jest`, `junit`. Valid runners: `vitest`, `playwright`, `jest`, `actrun`.
- `flaker debug confirm --json` — machine-readable verdict output.
- `flaker analyze query` now has three example queries in `--help`.
- `flaker debug doctor` and `flaker policy check` validate config value ranges.
- Top-level `--help` is organized into Getting started, Daily workflow, and nine category sections.
- Vitest is configured with a 60s global timeout and a 4-worker fork cap to stabilize DuckDB + MoonBit core tests.

### Internal

- `src/cli/main.ts` shrunk from 2076 lines to ~200 lines. Category registration lives under `src/cli/categories/`.
- Every command handler lives under `src/cli/commands/<category>/<name>.ts`.
- The MoonBit parquet fixture test is now invoked automatically by the vitest global setup, removing a hidden cross-language test dependency.
