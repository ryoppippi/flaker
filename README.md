# flaker

`flaker` is a test-intelligence toolkit for:

- sampling a smaller local test run from history and changed files
- detecting flaky tests in noisy CI environments
- measuring how well local sampled runs predict CI
- embedding the same core logic in MoonBit as a library

It is designed for repositories where:

- the full test suite is too expensive to run on every change
- CI failures are noisy because flaky tests are mixed with real regressions
- developers need a smaller local test run that still correlates well with CI

`flaker` helps answer:

- Which tests should I run for this change?
- How much can I shrink local execution without losing too much confidence?
- Which tests are actually flaky?
- How well does local sampled execution predict CI outcomes?

> **Upgrading from 0.0.x / 0.1.x?** See [docs/how-to-use.md#config-migration](docs/how-to-use.md#config-migration) for the full key rename map. Starting with `0.2.0`, the CLI refuses to start on legacy configs and points to the migration guide.

## Install as a CLI

```bash
pnpm add -D @mizchi/flaker
```

Or run it without installing:

```bash
pnpm dlx @mizchi/flaker --help
```

Requirements:

- Node.js 24+
- pnpm 10+

## Use as a MoonBit Library

`flaker` also publishes a MoonBit library surface at `mizchi/flaker`.

The root package re-exports both:

- pure computation APIs
- the shared contract types they consume and return

If you prefer a stricter import boundary, the same types are still available
from `mizchi/flaker/contracts`.

```moonbit
import {
  "mizchi/flaker" @flaker,
}

test "sample from historical runs" {
  let meta = @flaker.build_sampling_meta(
    [
      @flaker.SamplingHistoryRowInput::{
        suite: "tests/login.spec.ts",
        test_name: "login works",
        task_id: Some("web-login"),
        filter: None,
        variant: None,
        test_id: None,
        status: "passed",
        retry_count: 0,
        duration_ms: 1200,
        created_at: "2026-04-03T00:00:00.000Z",
      },
    ],
    [
      @flaker.SamplingListedTestInput::{
        suite: "tests/login.spec.ts",
        test_name: "login works",
        task_id: Some("web-login"),
        filter: None,
        variant: None,
        test_id: None,
      },
    ],
  )

  let sampled = @flaker.sample_weighted(meta, count=1, seed=1UL)
  assert_eq(sampled.length(), 1)
}
```

The root library surface intentionally re-exports pure logic only:

- flaky detection: `detect_flaky`
- sampling: `build_sampling_meta`, `sample_random`, `sample_weighted`, `sample_hybrid`
- affected analysis: `resolve_affected`, `build_affected_report`, `build_affected_report_from_input`
- stable identity: `create_stable_test_id`, `resolve_test_identity`
- graph helpers: `find_affected_nodes`, `expand_transitive`, `topological_sort`
- report reducers: `summarize_report`, `classify_report_diff`, `aggregate_report`
- policy: `summarize_quarantine`, `compute_quarantine_exit_code`, `run_config_check`
- metrics: `build_sampling_kpi`

Contracts remain separate so the API boundary stays explicit and reusable from
other packages.

## Experimental Direct MoonBit CLI

The MoonBit command package at `mizchi/flaker/cmd/flaker` is now directly
executable on both JS and native targets:

```bash
moon run src/cmd/flaker --target js -- --help
moon run src/cmd/flaker --target native -- --version
```

This direct entrypoint is intentionally narrow for now:

- `--help`
- `--version`
- JS bridge exports used by the npm CLI

Host and integration features such as GitHub collection, DuckDB-backed storage,
artifact ingestion, and archive handling will be migrated incrementally through
target-specific `_js.mbt` / `_native.mbt` modules.

## Core Workflow

`flaker` is most useful when you repeat this loop:

1. Collect or import test results from CI and local runs.
2. Build history for flaky detection and sampling.
3. Ask `flaker` to choose a smaller local test set.
4. Run the sampled tests and compare local outcomes with CI.
5. Evaluate whether the sampling strategy is actually trustworthy.

## Quick Start

1. **Initialize**: `flaker init` — creates `flaker.toml`, auto-detects repo from git remote
2. **Calibrate**: `flaker collect calibrate` — analyzes history and writes optimal sampling config
3. **Check environment**: `flaker debug doctor` — verifies DuckDB, MoonBit, and config
4. **Run**: `flaker run` — selects and executes tests (auto-detected profile)

### Initialize

```bash
flaker init --owner your-org --name your-repo
```

This creates `flaker.toml`.

### Collect test history

From GitHub Actions:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token)
flaker collect --days 30
```

From a local report file:

```bash
flaker import report <file> --adapter playwright --commit "$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
```

From actrun local history:

```bash
flaker collect local --last 20
```

To execute through `actrun`, configure the workflow path explicitly:

```toml
[runner]
type = "playwright"
command = "pnpm exec playwright test -c playwright.config.ts"

[runner.actrun]
workflow = ".github/workflows/ci.yml"
local = true
trust = true
# job = "e2e"
```

### Inspect flakiness

```bash
flaker analyze flaky
flaker analyze reason
flaker analyze eval
```

Useful evaluation outputs:

```bash
flaker analyze eval --json
flaker analyze eval --markdown --window 7
flaker analyze eval --markdown --window 7 --output .artifacts/flaker-review.md
```

The markdown mode is meant for weekly review notes. It summarizes:

- health score
- flaky counts
- local/CI sampling correlation
- average sample ratio
- average saved minutes
- fallback rate

### Sample tests before pushing

```bash
flaker run --dry-run --strategy hybrid --count 25
flaker run --dry-run --strategy affected --changed src/foo.ts
flaker run --dry-run --profile local --changed src/foo.ts
```

### Sample and execute

```bash
flaker run --strategy hybrid --count 25
flaker run --strategy affected --changed src/foo.ts
flaker run --profile local --changed src/foo.ts
flaker run --runner actrun
```

`flaker run` stores the local sampled run and records sampling telemetry so you can later measure:

- `P(CI pass | local pass)`
- `P(CI fail | local fail)`
- false negatives / false positives
- average saved minutes

When flaker has no local history yet, the sampling summary now explains the cold-start fallback and suggests the next steps to build usable history.

## Execution Profiles

flaker automatically selects the right strategy for each execution context:

| Profile | Strategy | Auto-detected |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| `scheduled` | `full` (all tests) | `--profile scheduled` (explicit only) |
| `ci` | `hybrid` + adaptive percentage | `CI=true` |
| `local` | `affected` + `fallback_strategy` + time budget | default |

```bash
# Auto-detect (CI → ci, otherwise → local)
flaker run

# Explicit
flaker run --profile scheduled
flaker run --profile ci
flaker run --profile local
```

Configure in `flaker.toml`:

```toml
[profile.scheduled]
strategy = "full"

[profile.ci]
strategy = "hybrid"
sample_percentage = 30
adaptive = true        # auto-adjust based on false negative rate

[profile.local]
strategy = "affected"
max_duration_seconds = 60
fallback_strategy = "weighted"
```

Data flows downstream: daily accumulates history → CI uses it for smarter sampling → local uses dependency graph for fast feedback. The `adaptive` flag automatically reduces CI percentage when data quality is high.

For local dogfooding, the practical loop is:

```bash
flaker exec affected --changed src/foo.ts
flaker run --dry-run --profile local --changed src/foo.ts
flaker run --profile local --changed src/foo.ts
```

## CI Integration

### PR Comments

Post test results directly on pull requests:

```yaml
- name: Run flaker
  run: flaker run --profile ci

- name: Post PR comment
  if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
  run: |
    flaker report summary --adapter vitest --input report.json --pr-comment \
      | gh pr comment ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --body-file -
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Auto-create Issues for Quarantined Tests

When flaky tests are auto-quarantined, create tracking issues:

```bash
flaker policy quarantine --auto --create-issues
```

This creates a GitHub Issue per quarantined test via `gh` CLI, with flaky rate, run count, and fix instructions. Requires `gh` to be installed and authenticated.

### Self-Host Rollout

The repo now ships two GitHub-native self-host lanes:

- [ci.yml](https://github.com/mizchi/flaker/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml): a `self-host-advisory` job runs on pull requests, executes `flaker run --profile ci`, snapshots `kpi` / `eval`, and updates a sticky PR comment.
- [nightly-self-host.yml](https://github.com/mizchi/flaker/blob/main/.github/workflows/nightly-self-host.yml): a scheduled job rebuilds recent CI history with `flaker collect`, runs `flaker run --profile scheduled`, and updates a rolling issue labeled `flaker-self-host`.

Both lanes render the same promotion-readiness summary from `scripts/self-host-review.mjs`. The current default is still advisory: the PR job is non-blocking, and the nightly workflow carries the long-form trend.

Promote `flaker run --profile ci` to a required check only after the nightly issue shows:

- `matched commits >= 20`
- `false negative rate <= 5%`
- `pass correlation >= 95%`
- `holdout FNR <= 10%`
- `data confidence` reaches `moderate` or `high`

## Recommended Usage Model

Start with advisory mode, not CI gating.

The most practical rollout looks like this:

1. `flaker run --profile scheduled` in a nightly scheduled workflow (full test + data accumulation)
2. `flaker run --profile ci` on PR push (selective execution, posts PR comment)
3. `flaker run --profile local` during development (fast feedback)
4. Review `flaker analyze eval` weekly
5. Only tighten the workflow after local-to-CI correlation looks strong

This works best in repositories with:

- long CI times
- flaky tests
- structured reports such as Playwright JSON, JUnit XML, or Vitest JSON

## Main Commands

### Collection and import

```bash
flaker collect
flaker collect local
flaker import report <file> --adapter playwright
flaker collect coverage --format istanbul --input coverage/coverage-final.json
```

### Sampling and execution

```bash
flaker run --dry-run --strategy random --count 20
flaker run --dry-run --strategy weighted --count 20
flaker run --dry-run --strategy affected
flaker run --dry-run --strategy hybrid --count 50

flaker run --strategy hybrid --count 50
flaker run --strategy affected --changed src/foo.ts
```

### Flag precedence

```
Resolution order (highest to lowest):
  1. Explicit CLI flag          (--strategy, --percentage, --count)
  2. [profile.<name>] in flaker.toml   (via --profile or auto-detection)
  3. [sampling] in flaker.toml         (project default)
  4. Built-in defaults

Notes:
  --count overrides --percentage when both are given
  --changed overrides git auto-detection
  --dry-run suppresses execution, still records selection telemetry
  --explain can be combined with --dry-run or a real run
```

### Analysis

```bash
flaker analyze flaky
flaker analyze reason
flaker analyze eval
flaker dev train
flaker analyze query "SELECT * FROM test_results LIMIT 20"
```

### Confirm suspected failures

```bash
# Remote: triggers workflow_dispatch, waits for result
flaker debug confirm "tests/api.test.ts:handles timeout"
flaker debug confirm "tests/api.test.ts:handles timeout" --repeat 10

# Local: runs via test runner directly
flaker debug confirm "tests/api.test.ts:handles timeout" --runner local
```

Output: `BROKEN` (regression), `FLAKY` (intermittent), or `TRANSIENT` (not reproducible).

Requires `.github/workflows/flaker-confirm.yml` for remote mode — generated by `flaker init`.

### Retry CI failures locally

```bash
# Re-run failed tests from most recent CI failure
flaker debug retry

# From a specific workflow run
flaker debug retry --run 12345678
```

Fetches the test result artifact from the failed CI run, identifies failed tests, and re-runs them locally. Reports which failures reproduce (real regressions) vs which don't (CI-specific or flaky).

### Policy and ownership

```bash
flaker policy quarantine
flaker policy quarantine --auto --create-issues
flaker policy check
flaker exec affected --changed src/foo.ts
```

### Reporting

```bash
flaker report summary --adapter vitest --input report.json --markdown
flaker report summary --adapter vitest --input report.json --pr-comment
flaker report diff --base base.json --head head.json
```
